00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:49,206
A long, long time ago,
there was a tree...

8
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:53,603
And a young man
who loved the tree.

9
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,145
Every single day
he came to the tree,

10
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,049
and collected

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,283
all falling leaves.

12
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,356
Hyung-sook,
l have to hang up.

13
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,396
- l'll call you back.
- Coming home...

14
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,956
this time for sure?

15
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:17,196
Of course,
no matter what.

16
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,366
You must teach her
to take daddy's call

17
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,378
even if she doesn't want to.

18
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,279
Maybe daddy didn't
educate her properly.

19
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,281
Educate?

20
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,644
lt's you, not me.

21
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,847
l gave her

22
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,856
the best education.

23
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,357
Sending her
to private school

24
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,790
isn't good education.

25
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,396
Sir! lt's Tae-soon!

26
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,664
You rarely saw her

27
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,859
- when you had the chance.
- Okay, fine.

28
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,162
l'll call you back later.

29
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,759
Don't bother.

30
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,667
l love you.

31
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,103
Bullshit!

32
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,102
Tae-soon, it's me.

33
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:59,809
Okay, l got it.

34
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,082
Thank you,
you're a good guy.

second-cousin

40
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,313
Doesn't make sense.

41
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,650
How long will it take?

42
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,742
About 3 days.

43
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,185
3 day? Not good enough!
Move over.

44
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,501
What the...

45
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,052
Excuse me.

46
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,892
Which way is
to Johan Cathedral?

47
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,793
Johan Cathedral?

48
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,894
Stay on this street...

49
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,101
l could guide you better
if you give me a ride.

50
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,475
Been well?

51
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,190
My kid's first birthday
next month.

52
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,194
Are you happy?

53
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,493
Yeah, you?

54
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,300
l'm leaving soon.

55
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,895
You must miss them.

56
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,673
How about a u-turn?

57
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,006
No police around.

58
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,707
- Now?
- Now.

59
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,277
Hey,
where are you going?

60
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,488
l'm sorry sir
l think l lost them.

61
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,685
lncompetent bastard.

62
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,996
Keep driving and go home,
you idiot!

63
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,502
Everyone get ready
and standby.

64
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,165
We don't know
wherethey'll end up

65
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,471
so wait in the car.
Confirm last location.

66
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,010
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

67
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:59,419
&nbsp

68
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,887
Shouldn't we call
the other team?

69
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,185
And give them
the credit?

70
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,283
We can take care
of it ourselves.

71
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,502
Excuse me.

72
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,512
l need to...

73
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:02,714
use the restroom.

74
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,989
Dance for me.

75
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,800
l said dance.

76
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,610
Trendy dance that
the kids here like.

77
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,096
Very nice.

78
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,199
Looks like
all our funding

79
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,004
went to dance classes.

80
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,444
Since you're more agile,

81
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,075
you come with me upstairs.

82
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,082
And you stay below.

83
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,758
What are you?

84
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,058
- Delivery man?
- Yeah.

85
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,565
Kyung-nam,
you look plain

86
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,294
even without the disguise.

87
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,363
You don't drive well,

88
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,099
get in the backseat.

89
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,679
lt's Gui Soong-min apartment!

90
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,907
Let's go!

91
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,882
Wait, who lives there?

92
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,556
Kim Sung-hak
Kim Jung-il's second cousin.

93
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,993
Fuck me.

94
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,199
Keep this.

95
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,510
After it's done, we'll part
on the first floor.

96
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,775
Rendezvous
at the terminal

97
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,076
and go back together.

98
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,583
Okay.

99
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,788
l can already feel
the bloodbath.

100
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:40,004
Accent in front,
out of the way!

101
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,200
lt's the director.

102
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,373
Lee Han-kyu here.

103
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,276
What do you think
you're doing?!

104
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,338
'Shadow' is on the move.

105
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,543
- lf we loose him...
- Shitbag!

106
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,642
Why didn't you
report this!

107
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,688
lt happened too quickly
so l'll report afterward

108
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,690
l got you.

109
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,385
That's all l need to do.

110
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,692
Who is it?

111
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,195
Morning,
l'm from the church.

112
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,097
ls Mr. Kim Sung-hak home?

113
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,306
He went to
the corner store.

114
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,175
You are... mother-in-law?

115
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,284
Yes, that's right.

116
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,076
Slow down, you'll trip.

117
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,783
l'm gonna get you!

118
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,007
What?

119
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,376
l don't think
this was necessary...

120
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,542
l'll be frank since
you're like my son.

121
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,451
Romantic Southerners
are whores.

122
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,988
Every one of them.

123
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,353
Look at them.

124
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,756
She married a defector
out of compassion and was killed

125
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,089
because of it.

126
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,494
Let's go in

127
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,208
We're here.
Where are you, Tae-soon?

128
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,690
You backstabbing rat,
take a good look.

129
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,155
You leached off our
nation's generosities

130
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,494
but publish a book
that taunt our leader?

131
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:58,294
l dreamt of killing you
every night.

132
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,966
- lt's apartment #1103.
- #1103...

133
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,511
You go first that way.

134
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,644
Clear the way!

135
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,778
- What's the floor?
- 11th floor!

136
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,763
- Comrade...
- Son of a bitch!

137
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,163
- He's just a child...
- Remember.

138
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,099
Our great nation
cannot have

139
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,697
a single fragile son.

140
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,501
How dare you
betray me?!

141
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,880
lt wasn't me.
l don't know anything.

142
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,792
Freeze!

143
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,565
l just live next door.

144
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,191
The boy was crying.

145
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,296
- Min-chul, head up.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,701
- No problem downstairs.
- Get up.

147
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,389
Hands up, asshole!

148
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,190
Target confirmed.

149
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,000
Check him.

150
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,505
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

151
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,008
He's okay.

152
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,304
ls that you Min-chul?

153
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,182
Min-chul!

154
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,185
Min-chul!

155
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,787
Son of a bitch!

156
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,086
What's going on?
Agent Ko!

157
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,092
Hey!

158
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,757
Get the car around
that side!

159
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,889
- Back off!
- Ko Kyung-nam!

160
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,794
- Agent Ko!
- Sir...

161
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,098
- Pull back right away!
- Sir, one went down!

162
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,899
Si-kyung!
Where's your mom?

163
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,480
- Take pictures of everything!
- Yes, sir.

164
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,279
Ko, give me the physical
description!

165
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,487
What's going on?

166
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,549
Over there, more people
coming out of there.

167
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,456
Yes, sir!

168
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,789
l said pull back!

169
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,466
Seal that exit!

170
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,002
Yes, sir. Out of the way!

171
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:23,306
6' tall wearing black suit

172
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,610
Out of the way!

173
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,350
- What the hell!
- Get in!

174
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,153
Are you okay?

175
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,888
- l'm fine, get in!
- Hurry.

176
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,457
- What about agent Kim?
- He's dead.

177
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,501
Shit!

178
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,199
Watch out!

179
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,278
Move! Move!

180
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,082
Step on the brake!

181
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,493
Shit!

182
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,587
Are you okay?

183
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,658
Go! Keep driving!

184
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,700
Yes, sir!

185
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,396
Watch out for the people!

186
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,185
Move! Out of the way!

187
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:20,992
Be careful.

188
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,103
l got you now.

189
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,179
- Floor it!
- Goddammit!

190
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,894
What the hell?

191
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,496
Why didn't you
request backup?!

192
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,203
Why?!

193
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,448
We can't keep up

194
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,977
with their pace through
normal chain of commands.

195
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,985
We must act first...

196
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,790
You be ready.

197
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,886
Hello?

198
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,801
l'm the agent in charge.

199
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,405
We're not
after you or Tae-soon.

200
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,968
Our target is

201
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,806
a North Korean assassin,

202
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,878
a high ranking officer.

203
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:02,879
He goes by many names

204
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,575
but commonly known
as Shadow.

205
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,378
That's who we want.

206
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,678
With your help,
we can get him.

207
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,582
l promise you
we'll help both of you

208
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,093
if we get him.

209
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,455
Tae-soon said
you graduated

210
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,498
from Kim Jung-il's
military school.

211
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,194
Aside from that,l don't know
anything about you.

212
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,197
Not even your face.

213
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,803
We can talk later
if you're in a situation.

214
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,039
l'll give you my number

215
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,675
Memorize it
011 865 92...

216
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,408
Betrayal, unforgivable

217
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,175
Two leaders
got together...

218
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:17,077
for the first time
in 55 years.

219
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,199
Hold on.

220
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,958
l suffered through
salary reduction

221
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,765
and disciplinary actions.

222
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,169
Now you want my throat?

223
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,799
Getting honorable
discharge

224
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,067
before official
staff reduction

225
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,807
is a generous way for us
to thank you for the work.

226
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:46,442
Having too many agents
on the field

227
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,952
is too much burden
for the agency.

228
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,282
Burden?

229
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,484
Were we getting paid
to fool around?

230
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,757
Our job is to catch
spies so

231
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,953
our people can
sleep soundly.

232
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,188
Times are changing.

233
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,294
Hostility is not
the answer anymore.

234
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,964
Their field operations are
coming to a halt.

235
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:08,767
Fine. But at least
let us finish this

236
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,705
before cutting us off.

237
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,572
l won't leave before
catching Shadow first.

238
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:17,672
Agent Lee
Stay out of this.

239
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,979
You've caused more
than enough problems.

240
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:26,748
l lost my teammates
who were like my family.

241
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,759
But l still have to
feed my real family.

242
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,192
You're divorced.

243
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,255
But l'm still
paying alimony.

244
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,697
What am l saying?

245
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,568
l can't just step down
during my prime.

246
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,663
This is why you
don't get anywhere.

247
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,868
You don't catch spies
to make money.

248
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,274
You're the reason

249
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:49,507
why our agency is
getting the bad rep.

250
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,481
Looks like this was decided
even before this meeting.

251
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,552
ls it because
of field problems?

252
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,144
Or getting divorced?

253
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,656
Just stick to one reason
for termination.

254
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,691
What did you say?

255
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:04,086
Do you know why l didn't
bother reporting?

256
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,962
What's the point?

257
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,694
You're goddamn
pushover and a tool.

258
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,398
You bastard!

259
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,103
Once is plenty enough.

260
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,804
Where do you think you are?!

261
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,138
Calm down, Agent Lee.

262
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:30,051
Let go of me!

263
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,646
Changing times? Fuck that!

264
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,885
l'm a federal agent
who catch commies!

265
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,979
6 years later

266
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,649
Hey, don't do it!

267
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,454
- You wanted it.
- lt won't be good.

268
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,585
- You were gonna do it.
- lt's dirty.

269
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:17,065
Hey miss
your food's great.

270
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,263
Could l take some photos
and post it online?

271
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,305
Online where?

272
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,368
An online club

273
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,171
for finding good restaurants.

274
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,711
Sure.

275
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,750
Come here
and give me a hand.

276
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,087
Quickly, customers
are waiting.

277
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,300
Here it is.

278
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:19,359
There're address, phone number
and even directions.

279
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,661
For extra $2,000,

280
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,667
we can bring her
back for you.

281
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:28,104
No, l'll go myself.

282
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:31,609
Okay.

283
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,479
Thank you.

284
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,285
Looks like your life
is hard enough.

285
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,957
l hope that
you'll be happier

286
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,999
when your wife comes back.

287
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,299
l'll be on my way then.

288
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,473
Hey, Yoon-ji.

289
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,600
Daddy?
l'm working right now.

290
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:11,448
Don't just like mommy.
You have to be good.

291
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,451
Yoon-ji,
don't call me too much.

292
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,147
Mommy won't like it.

293
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,154
Mommy's not there?

294
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:22,455
Don't worry about me, okay?

295
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,494
Hello?

296
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,960
Hey! lt's slanted!

297
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,088
Quit fooling around!

298
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,859
l'm paying each
of you $1,500.

299
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,596
You guys
are highway robbers!

300
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:41,307
Specialists in finding
runaway foreign wives

301
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,375
Chief!

302
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,350
Congratulations
on your promotion!

303
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,047
You didn't need to
come on a rainy day.

304
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,683
These guys were brokering
international marriages.

305
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,753
Vietnamese,

306
00:29:56,828 --> 00:30:00,787
Filipino, Cambodian and
other Asian countries.

307
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,495
They bring the girls over,
marry them

308
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:05,564
then convince them

309
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,764
that there're better men.

310
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,467
They're ripping off
poor farmers.

311
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,067
Look at this appalling face.

312
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,475
This is the boss.

313
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,982
He's half Korean
but worse than the Vietnamese.

314
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,140
But this is
an organization.

315
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:24,177
l know you're the best
man for this.

316
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,788
They must be stirring
quite a bit.

317
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:35,863
The department put high
reward on them.

318
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,401
About $60,000.

319
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,667
Sixty?

320
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,706
l hear they go to
the factory

321
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,866
where many
Vietnamese work.

322
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:49,505
The boss goes
nuts over soccer.

323
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:04,092
Go over there.
Sweep thoroughly

324
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,448
Playing basketball
in a soccer field, morons!

325
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,286
Hey!
What are you doing?

326
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,492
- You're not here to watch soccer!
- Okay.

327
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,069
- Jae-hwan.
- Yes, sir.

328
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,573
Do you see that guy
in Yankees hat?

329
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:51,904
Fat guy in white suit.

330
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:57,038
Yes.

331
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,140
l can't verify
from my position,

332
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,479
but what do you think?

333
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,647
l'll check up close.

334
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,744
Hey, hey!

335
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,789
Hey, hey! Not yet!

336
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,600
That crazy idiot!

337
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,674
l think it's him.
Should l grab him?

338
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,176
Do you want to get killed?
Get out of there!

339
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,212
Okay.

340
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,479
Jae-hwan! Jae-hwan!

341
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,659
Sang-chul,
l can't spot Jae-hwan.

342
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,665
Jae-hwan?

343
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:49,961
Did you see a guy
in Yankees hat?

344
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,059
A what? Yangi?

345
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,798
Find Jae-hwan first,
quick!

346
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,409
Why aren't you
answering me!

347
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,444
What are you doing here?
Boss is looking for you.

348
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,540
And why's your
radio set off?

349
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,777
You can't...

350
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,546
Boss, we're
fucked here.

351
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:15,091
All right, l'll be there.

352
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:27,768
Hey!

353
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,807
Do your worst, come at me.

354
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,278
That's it.

355
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,041
l'll get
the minions,

356
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,776
grab that bastard
over there.

357
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,478
Got it? Now!

358
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,893
Hey, where are you going?!

359
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,393
Shit!

360
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,500
Fake? Fake?

361
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,005
lt's a gas gun!

362
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,184
Hey, hey, stop, stop!

363
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,708
Stop it!

364
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,602
l called the cops.

365
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,384
Stop!

366
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,987
Stop!

367
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,584
l'm letting you live
because the game was tied.

368
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,391
l'll kill you...

369
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,696
if we meet again.

370
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,598
Shut it down!

371
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,455
Are you okay?

372
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,395
Yeah.
Are you a worker here?

373
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,601
You're a Korean.

374
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,906
Are you a cop?

375
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,469
No, l run a small...

376
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,945
They're wanted men.

377
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,447
l was after
the reward money...

378
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,780
with a gas gun.

379
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,885
Your name is?

380
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,286
What for?

381
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,059
Just want to thank you.

382
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,186
Ki-joon!

383
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,895
Go treat your wounds.

384
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:30,879
Hey!

385
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,187
What is it?

386
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:42,458
lt's weird to ask you
this like this,

387
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,893
but would you consider
working for me?

388
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,764
What type of work?

389
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,391
Finding people.

390
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,804
lt's a real enterprise
and well commended.

391
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,504
Looked like finding wasn't
the only thing.

392
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:08,749
Ah, that happens once every
10 years if l'm lucky.

393
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,343
l was helping
out local cops.

394
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,355
l'm find where l am.

395
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:17,360
Of course.
But l noticed that

396
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:21,159
you may be
an asset to me.

397
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,699
Your name was...?

398
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,662
Park Ki-joon.

399
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:30,571
Park Ki-joon.
Your fighting skills...

400
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,370
l mean, physical condition...

401
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,274
and you speak
Vietnamese well.

402
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,575
Where did you
learn to speak?

403
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,945
Most of our workers are
Vietnamese, so...

404
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:43,476
lt's perfect.
l'm in the business of

405
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,153
finding
Vietnamese women.

406
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:47,656
We haven't known each
other long

407
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,091
but why don't you
come work for me?

408
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,688
l like
my current work.

409
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:56,465
Of course.

410
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,399
lt's time
for me to go.

411
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,906
How about you call me.

412
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,775
Park Ki-joon
my ass.

413
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:14,675
l got you Ji-won.

414
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,095
Boss, are you okay?

415
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,300
Key.

416
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,402
Here.

417
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,803
Live well,
stop wasting your life.

418
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,312
He's really leaving.

419
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,373
Boss!

420
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,256
- Hello?
- lt's me.

421
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,259
- Who?
- lt's your daddy, idiot!

422
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,852
Who? Agent Lee?

423
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,590
- Kyung-nam.
- Yes, sir!

424
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,099
- l just hit the jackpot.
- Huh?

425
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,204
Who is it?

426
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,003
Pork feet!

427
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,310
Pork?

428
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:17,971
Sir!

429
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,382
You still go
around like this?

430
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:28,549
ls that true?

431
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,958
Like l said.
He's there as the manager.

432
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,859
Ji-won didn't
recognize your face?

433
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,557
Of course not,
he has never seen me.

434
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,656
But you recognized him?

435
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,758
l knew right away.

436
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,359
Man, weren't you surprised?

437
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,064
Did he not clue in?

438
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,072
l pretended
to be oblivious.

439
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,665
lf l acted like
l knew him,

440
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:46,801
it would've been
game over.

441
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,606
You know l have a knack
for acting.

442
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,447
ln any case, thank you.

443
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:54,678
My arrest rate
isn't great lately.

444
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,946
- Kyung-nam.
- Yeah?

445
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,683
l didn't call you
to hand him over.

446
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:02,992
Aren't you going to
report him in?

447
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,160
l'm leading this.

448
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,356
You're just
supporting me.

449
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:08,693
Do you get it?

450
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,100
No, l don't.

451
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:12,702
Keep it away from
the agency, you idiot!

452
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,105
Okay...

453
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,900
What's the reward
for spies nowadays?

454
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,310
$100,000

455
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:22,710
And spy ring?

456
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,279
Huh?

457
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,680
Unification Policy
Research Facility

458
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,186
You don't look well.

459
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,593
l met an NlS agent
a few days ago by chance.

460
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:22,098
Lee Han-kyu,

461
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,967
who looked for Tae-soon
and me 6 years ago.

462
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,102
Lee Han-kyu?

463
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:33,146
Yes. He asked me to work for him

464
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,878
as if he didn't recognize me.

465
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,754
Looks like
a private agency.

466
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,384
On the surface.

467
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,993
l'm sure
it's just his cover.

468
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:51,194
- So?
- l don't know.

469
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,303
Maybe submit
an undercover report.

470
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,807
Ji-won.

471
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,204
How about

472
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,143
- surrendering?
- You made me

473
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,978
into what l am
in military school.

474
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,579
And now you're asking me
to betray my country?

475
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:14,554
Like you?

476
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:15,683
Watch your mouth!

477
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,390
So what are you
going to do?

478
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,092
l've been on the
run for 6 years.

479
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:29,005
lt's time
to end this.

480
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,201
l won't visit you
again.

481
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,243
Won't it be better
to switch him over?.

482
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,649
ln an unofficial
route.

483
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,846
Like Tae-soon?

484
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,754
The spies are nuts
over working

485
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,452
for us after their
funding ran dry.

486
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,585
l already asked him
to work with me.

487
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,295
Yeah?
What did he say?

488
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:56,563
But he likes his work.

489
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,158
- What...
- Anyway,

490
00:43:58,235 --> 00:43:59,793
Come relief me when you're done.

491
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,347
- Hello?
- Sir, it's me.

492
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:16,045
Why didn't you show up
yesterday?

493
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,246
- The director's here.
- Hey!

494
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,188
- l'll call you back.
- You're the one who called.

495
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,459
ls he gone?

496
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,463
lt's Park Ki-joon,
we met a couple of days ago.

497
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:29,795
Who? Park Ki-joon?

498
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,101
Ah, Mr. Park!
Park Ki-joon!

499
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,600
Yes, sure.
How can l help you?

500
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,107
Ah, l see.

501
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,798
- Had lunch yet?
- Not yet.

502
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,606
How about a burger?

503
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,203
l don't like burgers.

504
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,373
Anyway, you chose wisely.

505
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,447
We have to push our
strongest traits.

506
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:23,645
Even the office workers

507
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,383
look for a way
out in their 40s.

508
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:31,058
l haven't
decided yet.

509
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,356
l wanted to hear
the conditions.

510
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:36,798
l see. You must need
a lot of money.

511
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,296
Downpayment
for an apartment.

512
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:45,199
Apartment? How big?

513
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:47,776
About 100m©÷

514
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:51,076
A self-made man,
so young too.

515
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,384
Apartment...

516
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,451
That's our
nation's problem.

517
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:58,852
People become rich over it,

518
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,550
families get broken up,

519
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,991
but it also unites
others, like us.

520
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,587
How much will you pay me?

521
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:14,002
l paid my old employees
$2,000 total...

522
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:18,474
But l can't give you that,

523
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,375
it's hardly enough for you.

524
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,707
$2,500?

525
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:26,576
Add another 200?

526
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,378
$3,000! Housing included!

527
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,451
l'm sorry...

528
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:36,857
l get that
with my current job.

529
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,361
Of course,

530
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:40,760
but l'm not done yet.

531
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,696
There's also incentives.

532
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:46,468
How much will that be?

533
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,506
Usually incentives
are...10%.

534
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:54,102
30%...No higher.

535
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,579
When do l start?

536
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:00,674
Right now.

537
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:12,255
You don't need to
bring gifts every time.

538
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,354
Bro, it's Thanksgiving.

539
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,798
Thanksgiving is in 4 months.

540
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:20,569
Who's he?

541
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:21,968
Ki-joon, greet him.

542
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,472
He's my new employee.

543
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,371
Yeah?

544
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,569
Where are you from?

545
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:30,078
Why are yo u asking
stuff like that?

546
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:32,377
lt's Haenam, sir.

547
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:36,185
Really? Where in Haenam?

548
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,554
Why? Don't l look country?

549
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:42,683
lt's not that,
you don't have a dialect.

550
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,962
Don't you know
each other?

551
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,794
No, it's not that.

552
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:52,601
Bro,
l have something to ask.

553
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:54,997
Take a look.

554
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:17,082
Boss, why
are you following me?

555
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:18,995
Right, right.

556
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,901
Hey, please stop.

557
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,095
You won't go far like this.

558
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:35,476
You're gonna
tire yourself out.

559
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:40,573
No! No!

560
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,280
One case completed.

561
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,690
ls that absolutely
necessary?

562
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,153
- What?
- The cuffs.

563
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,357
Ma'am, l'm sorry.

564
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,195
l'll uncuff you at home.

565
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:03,268
Please uncuff her,
this is torture.

566
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,568
lf she escapes
after we get her,

567
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:05,903
she's gone for good.

568
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:09,209
How can she escape
while the car's running?

569
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,892
Listen, Ki-joon.

570
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,064
Do you have to
make it unpleasant

571
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:35,161
on our first day
together?

572
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:35,966
Did l beat her?

573
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:37,563
Or curse at her?

574
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,609
ls that any better
than either?

575
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:44,842
Listen to me. l have pride

576
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,041
in my work just like you do.

577
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,641
Why? l keep this nation's
families together.

578
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,243
We're not cops and

579
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,288
they haven't committed
any crimes.

580
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,584
Please treat them
like humans.

581
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:12,072
Ki-joon. There's a
dark side to our work.

582
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,610
What we do will have
positive effects...

583
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:18,136
Bastard,
an adult is talking.

584
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:21,582
You could do that
while we're moving!

585
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:23,686
Shit!

586
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,092
Come on in.

587
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,301
You can stay here with me.

588
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,971
lt's my office but

589
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,604
comfortable enough to stay.

590
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:53,482
Make yourself at home.

591
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,878
Side effect of living alone.

592
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:05,460
l'll use
the upstairs and

593
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,394
you can use
this space here.

594
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,997
Please don't come up.

595
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,894
lt just fell.

596
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,099
lt's a kitchen knife!

597
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,879
l must be nuts.
All this for money.

598
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:29,933
lnfiltrated as an employee,
lnternational Task Force

599
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,172
Tracing Son Tae-soon's
whereabouts

600
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:38,078
Address - Seoul,
Mapo-gu...

601
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,683
Still not back?

602
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:42,751
l haven't slept a wink.

603
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:46,346
What if he figures it out
and brings Shadow?

604
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:47,685
How could he know me?

605
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,793
Cut the crap,
l'm hanging up.

606
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:32,893
Where have you been?

607
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:38,897
Come in.
You have a guest too.

608
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:47,183
Where is that commie!

609
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,084
Where are the cuffs?

610
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:07,503
Yesterday, Ji-won...

611
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:49,503
Where were you?

612
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,449
This?

613
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,452
l was just testing it.

614
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,851
Doesn't work well.

615
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,287
Ki-joon,

616
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:04,691
the key please.

617
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,591
Just throw it.

618
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,898
What do we do today?

619
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,807
Yes, Mr. Jo.

620
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:28,479
We'll call you
when we find her.

621
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:31,887
Haven't slept well?

622
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,090
Should l drive?

623
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,891
No, only l drive this car.

624
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:47,002
That could've been nasty.

625
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:54,308
We're here.

626
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:58,840
You start from this side.

627
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:02,476
And l'll cover this area.

628
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,785
Rather than
an aimless approach,

629
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,448
you go diagonally like this.

630
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:13,792
And l take the opposite route.

631
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,861
lf not we flip
45 degrees and try again.

632
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,992
We'll get her for sure.

633
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:23,171
l know that method.

634
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:24,399
Where did you learn it?

635
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,602
Online.

636
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:31,477
lt's an old trick.

637
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:33,075
All right,
let's give it a try.

638
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:49,693
Yeah.

639
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,263
Any progress yet?

640
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:54,667
Progress?
l might be paying him $3,000.

641
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:55,965
$3,000?!

642
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,370
That's just base pay.

643
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,467
l had to lure him
with 30% incentive too...

644
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:05,036
What kind of communist
is so fixated on money?

645
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:06,479
Where is he spending
the money?

646
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:10,042
Says it's for
an apartment, shit.

647
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:12,280
All the while his boss is renting.

648
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,351
He pretends to be noble and

649
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,894
tells me l'm being inhumane.

650
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,560
He doesn't answer
anything properly.

651
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,792
He's practically
the boss around here!

652
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,663
l gotta find a way soon.

653
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,968
His salary's going
to be bigger than...

654
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,007
Find her?

655
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,170
Goddamn commie.

656
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,282
That's why

657
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:43,948
l have to find my wife.

658
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,578
Have you seen her?

659
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:50,187
We don't know.

660
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,761
Come on, play!

661
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:56,788
Me? lt's my turn?

662
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:01,061
This granny's hand
is worthless.

663
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,697
You could put your
hand down and call it.

664
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:09,411
No mercy when
it comes to gambling.

665
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:14,176
l found her.

666
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:33,302
Who's the other one?

667
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,468
They were together.

668
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,302
They must've escaped
with each other.

669
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,399
How did you bring them?

670
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:42,306
l convinced them...

671
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,745
Humanely.

672
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:48,079
l got the humane part,

673
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:50,686
but how did you
find them so fast?

674
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:54,285
ls that a problem?

675
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:59,486
No.

676
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:31,993
How old are you?

677
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:33,590
6 years old.

678
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:35,592
6?

679
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,166
l don't know
how to thank you...

680
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:46,970
Normally $2,000 for finding,

681
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,977
bringing back $2,000
for a total of $4,000

682
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:51,138
She wanted to come on
her own, so it's okay.

683
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,444
But if it wasn't for us...

684
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:56,041
l must repay you, humanely.

685
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,780
Of course, humanely.

686
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,584
Very humane, indeed.

687
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,588
What the hell?!

688
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,694
Get it! Quickly!

689
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,771
l got it, got it!

690
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,100
Nice! Nice!

691
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:23,578
Cuff it if we're
bringing it home.

692
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:46,097
Jesus Christ!

693
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,062
Move that somewhere!

694
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:51,572
lt's just food.

695
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,165
Let's not start already.

696
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:55,210
l don't want it, you eat it.

697
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:57,980
Delicious.

698
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:01,778
Genuine chicken broth.

699
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:14,493
Been a while since
someone cooked for me.

700
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:20,297
What happened
to your wife and daughter?

701
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:24,566
l wasn't much
of a husband to her.

702
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,471
This work can be demanding.

703
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:27,975
She remarried a British man

704
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,705
and moved to
England.

705
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,246
His name is Albert and

706
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:34,681
renamed my daughter Amy.

707
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,652
What kind of stupid name
is Amy?

708
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,085
Don't you want to see her?

709
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:41,954
l haven't seen her

710
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:43,389
once after they left.

711
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:46,161
l want to buy her a home

712
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:47,890
when she gets married.

713
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,297
You will be able to.

714
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:59,098
Of course, that's what l'll do.

715
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:03,871
Be good to your wife
when you get married.

716
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:20,992
NlS agent Lee Han-kyu
Divorced and lives alone.

717
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:28,601
Chicken broth

718
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:18,270
Okay! One more day!

719
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:22,277
Are you going out?

720
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:25,287
Go out and meet
some people too.

721
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,153
You're too young
to be cooked up in here.

722
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:30,487
Meet who?

723
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,088
A friend or a girlfriend?

724
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,192
No friends in Seoul.

725
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,490
And not interested
in girls.

726
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:40,002
Then go have fun
somewhere.

727
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,961
Don't waste your vacation
like this.

728
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,098
l'll just watch some TV.

729
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:34,582
Hello?

730
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:37,692
Hi, Yoon-ji.

731
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,595
Daddy's working.

732
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,295
What are you doing?

733
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:45,566
ls that so?

734
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:47,966
Albert's teaching you piano?

735
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,197
Must've been nice...

736
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:51,504
Do you like your new dad?

737
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,105
Like me better?

738
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:58,978
Birthday present?

739
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,745
Digital camera?

740
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:04,183
You can buy that there.

741
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:09,048
l'll send money so
ask your mom for it.

742
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:12,185
Daddy has to go, honey.

743
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:36,682
Could you cook something
nice for me? -Boss

744
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:53,195
Tae-soon! Over here!

745
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,277
Thank you, as always.

746
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:10,378
Let's all live well.

747
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,283
Quite cozy.

748
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,196
You sold your country

749
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:02,299
and comrades so you can
live like this?!

750
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:20,052
l'm treated like a traitor and

751
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:22,249
l can't go back
because of you!

752
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,985
You did this to me!

753
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,694
Say something!

754
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,891
l want to live.

755
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,363
l want to live!

756
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,598
Shit...

757
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:56,892
l'm sorry.

758
01:09:58,327 --> 01:09:59,487
What about the family?

759
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,788
Went to the in-laws
for a few days.

760
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,998
How did you know
l was here?

761
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,798
Didn't you meet
an NlS agent earlier?

762
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:16,772
No!

763
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:20,081
l'm not part
of that anymore.

764
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:28,283
And Lee is
not an agent anymore.

765
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:32,689
What are you talking about?

766
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,094
He took responsibilities
for that

767
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:37,890
botched operation
and was fired.

768
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:41,293
He doesn't work
for them anymore.

769
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:57,379
The director was asking
about you.

770
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,889
Me? What for?

771
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:03,748
ls hell freezing over?

772
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:07,284
He's up there for a long time.

773
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,295
lt was hard getting it.

774
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:10,997
lt's not even released yet.

775
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:15,570
lt's no biggie
triangulating a cell,

776
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:17,868
don't make a fuss over
a GPS tracker.

777
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,670
This will work
even when cells don't.

778
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:22,176
l'll take it back
if you don't like it.

779
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:24,644
Forget that.
Give me the receiver.

780
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:25,873
No one knows, right?

781
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:31,280
Yeah, okay.

782
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,088
There's a new development.

783
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,682
A big news?

784
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:40,461
l think something's up
in the North.

785
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:42,394
Yeah?
What's going on?

786
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:45,159
Go watch the news.

787
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:46,701
7th undercover report

788
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:57,976
You're back?

789
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,079
TV all day? Always
the same music show.

790
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:03,880
You trying to be a singer?

791
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,257
There is a breaking news.

792
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,562
North Korea will
carry out

793
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:22,263
a nuclear missile test
within a few days.

794
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,273
For our proud nation,

795
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:29,778
we have developed
nuclear weapon.

796
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,836
Why are those fuckers
acting up again?

797
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:34,041
lt's been known
that North Korea was

798
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:35,845
developing nuclear arsenal.

799
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:39,251
But this is the first official proof
of its existence.

800
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:41,755
This development
will renew

801
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:43,758
the tension
between two nations.

802
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:48,661
They claim that
the weapons will not be used

803
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:51,700
unless provoked
by the US...

804
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,681
What the hell!

805
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:25,763
What's with the suit?

806
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:28,064
Going somewhere nice?
Looks great.

807
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:29,695
There's a soiree.

808
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:31,106
A soiree?

809
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,572
lt's reunion.

810
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:35,769
l wanted to meet
some old friends.

811
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:37,778
What kind of school?

812
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,145
Primary.

813
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:44,185
Ah, elementary school.
Really old friends then.

814
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,788
Go on.

815
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:49,989
l might be late.

816
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:51,650
Have fun and

817
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,388
don't drink too much.

818
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:03,670
Kyung-nam!

819
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:05,070
- lt's time!
- Sir?.

820
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,370
He's going to
a school reunion.

821
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,671
So?

822
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:10,837
Think, you moron!

823
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:11,641
How could a guy

824
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:13,180
from the North go to
a South reunion?

825
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:47,573
Shadow?

826
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:00,854
Kyung-nam!

827
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:01,953
l'll send photos
of his associates

828
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,692
and plate numbers
so cross reference.

829
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:20,543
Keep driving!

830
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:21,878
Go, go!

831
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:48,375
l got a report that
he passed out at a bar.

832
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:49,273
l put a tail on him.

833
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:52,142
He doesn't normally drink.

834
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,079
Something's up.

835
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:59,146
Professor, producer, pastor

836
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:00,848
A commie producer,

837
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:02,982
no wonder this country's
going to shit.

838
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:05,757
Hello, l have some
special scoop,

839
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:06,953
could l talk to
producer Min Kyu-chul?

840
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:10,157
He went to China
on an assignment for a month.

841
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:12,757
Ah, on an assignment.

842
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,359
- l see.
- What's the scoop?

843
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:17,962
l shoved it up your asshole.

844
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,065
Professor and the producer
left yesterday

845
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:21,769
and only the pastor's
still in the country.

846
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:23,105
Why didn't you tell me earlier!

847
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:26,076
Have they realized
What we're up to?

848
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:27,547
A pastor.

849
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,641
l got you red bastards.

850
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:31,686
- Head for Hwagok.
- Yes, sir.

851
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:39,889
Pastor Lee?

852
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:41,857
Please come in.

853
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:42,897
Thank you.

854
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:51,401
You're all finished,
rat fuckers!

855
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:54,971
Who are you?
Why are you doing this?

856
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,477
We're Song Ji-won's friends.

857
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,673
l live with him.

858
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:03,082
Live together?

859
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,488
Don't know Song Ji-won?

860
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:12,860
How about Park Ki-joon.

861
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:15,158
Ah, ln-joon!

862
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:18,859
Are you referring
to Jo ln-joon?

863
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:22,097
ln-joon is our client.

864
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:32,170
Ow, my arm...

865
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,787
ln-joon

866
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:44,082
has family
in the North.

867
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,754
Wife and a daughter,

868
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:50,764
but he hasn't seen them
in 7 years, l'm told.

869
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:55,667
ln-joon was betrayed and

870
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:57,602
abandoned by
his own country.

871
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:02,076
He can't surrender
because of family

872
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:04,669
back home even
if he wanted to.

873
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,483
He couldn't wait
any longer so

874
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:11,386
he wanted to bring
his family,

875
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,779
so he came to us.

876
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:15,390
But

877
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:18,558
it was more costly
than he thought,

878
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:20,595
and l didn't hear
from him for a while.

879
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:24,460
This past summer

880
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,058
he came back, saying

881
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,466
he can get the money.

882
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:29,902
Apartment payment.

883
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:34,809
Then?

884
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:39,036
But before
we could get them out,

885
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:41,947
the nuclear incident happened.

886
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:46,181
So naturally the border
tightened up

887
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:51,388
Producer Min and Prof. Hwang
took off yesterday.

888
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,890
l guess this might be
the last chance.

889
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,492
Are you going to
report Ji-won now?

890
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,068
Wait a couple of day.

891
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:05,003
He's bringing
his family back.

892
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:08,409
Won't he surrender then?

893
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,883
Pretty, huh?

894
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:20,652
l went to Vietnam

895
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:23,748
and met 120 girls
in an hour

896
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:26,089
and she was the most
beautiful one.

897
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:29,261
lf a man's
going to remarry,

898
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,492
he must choose
the beautiful one.

899
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:35,298
Are you married?

900
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:39,006
No.

901
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:41,465
Young people

902
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:42,669
these days think it's better

903
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:44,336
- to live alone but...
- What's your wife's name?

904
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:49,179
Eunwenddi Ddooi An
Or Won Soo-young in Korean.

905
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:53,281
Beautiful but too smart.

906
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:56,789
Making a fuss over
some beatings.

907
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,891
- You could just go there.
- Thank you.

908
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:07,766
He'll beat her
if she comes back, right?

909
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:09,667
Hey, mind you
own business.

910
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:11,706
His family is not
your concern.

911
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,873
Capitalism is about
finding happiness

912
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:15,068
by taking another's wealth.

913
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:17,077
That's not a crime, okay?

914
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:19,241
Do you find happiness in

915
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,373
looking for
other men's women?

916
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:23,779
Watch your mouth!

917
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,985
You don't know
anything about me.

918
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:29,453
lsn't that the same?

919
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:32,493
Quit if you don't like it.
Bitch and moan.

920
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,186
Ddooi An? Miss Ddooi An?

921
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:03,552
Mr. Jung asked us
to find you.

922
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:05,286
Please come with us.

923
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:11,865
l'm not a Vietnamese,
l'm half Korean!

924
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:13,298
We already know.

925
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:17,502
Who are you?

926
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:19,766
Aren't you all illegal?

927
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:21,775
Should l get the
immigration down here?

928
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:22,810
Move!

929
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:24,177
Out of the way!

930
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:29,843
- l said l'm a Korean!
- Do something!

931
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:32,648
¢Ü l love this country!

932
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,746
Tihong! Call Tihong!

933
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:37,883
Sure, you're a Korean,
l have no doubt.

934
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:39,484
l'm sure about that.

935
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,363
Please stop!

936
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:51,701
Do you see them
only as money?

937
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:57,177
Son of a bitch!

938
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:02,677
Don't pretend to be humane.

939
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:05,649
You need the money too!

940
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,278
Remember the apartment?

941
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:10,489
No wonder your family left you.

942
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:14,194
What?
What did you just say?

943
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:46,055
You really want to
start this?

944
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:47,594
You bastard!

945
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,578
What are you waiting for!
Get out!

946
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:19,782
Did you see the news?
Our team lost.

947
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:22,095
You're all dead.

948
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:24,893
l didn't see the match.

949
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,302
Once in 10 years or so, huh?

950
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:38,276
lt's because we didn't
settle last time.

951
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:40,479
What do you think?

952
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:42,776
You?

953
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,084
Can you manage?

954
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:52,786
Damn it.

955
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:52,884
Go, you bastard!

956
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:55,584
l said go!

957
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:06,901
Are you okay?

958
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:10,804
l'm not okay.

959
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:36,890
Look at that traffic.

960
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:38,556
An accident?

961
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:39,657
Ah, it's Thanksgiving.

962
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:42,760
Everyone's heading home.

963
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:45,101
But look at us.
Bruised and battered.

964
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:49,071
You're lucky to be spending

965
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:50,577
Thanksgiving with family.

966
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:01,579
Did your husband
beat you a lot?

967
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:08,091
l can have
Korean citizenship

968
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,198
2 years after wedding.

969
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:14,861
But he won't
sponsor me for it.

970
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:17,996
Saying l'd leave him
when l get it.

971
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,003
Whenever l ask him
about it

972
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,172
he hits me.

973
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:28,548
l have a favor.

974
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:33,076
Could l see my sister on the way?

975
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:36,784
She also married here.

976
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:39,693
l haven't seen her
in over 5 years.

977
01:26:40,428 --> 01:26:41,690
l beg of you.

978
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:51,405
Newan!

979
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:58,674
Sister, is this really you?

980
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:06,587
Ki-joon!

981
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:11,392
Yeah?

982
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:13,494
Let's just go.

983
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:24,696
Too bad about the payment.

984
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,604
Eh, it's only
a couple of bucks.

985
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:32,142
Why did you let that boss go?

986
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:34,374
When we get the reward,
you're gonna leave.

987
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:37,778
l'd hate to let you go once
you have your apartment.

988
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:44,388
You'll make me
more money over time.

989
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:47,753
Cheers!

990
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:50,354
While Thanksgiving took
all over the country,

991
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:52,763
North Korea has...

992
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:54,597
Thanksgiving is no big deal.

993
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:59,864
UN Security Council announced that
they will enforce sanctions

994
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:03,172
when North Korea proceeds
the nuclear tests.

995
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:06,008
Therefore, the Government
convenes a meeting

996
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:09,240
to seek a solution with advisors.

997
01:28:09,317 --> 01:28:12,548
Especially Prof. Ji,
Unification Policy Researcher would

998
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:16,716
advise on expected venues
for the nuclear test.

999
01:28:16,824 --> 01:28:20,385
How long have
we worked together?

1000
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:23,463
About 4 months.

1001
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:25,590
That long already?

1002
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:31,703
Don't you miss
your family?

1003
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:34,999
l'm divorced!

1004
01:28:39,113 --> 01:28:40,341
What's the point
in missing them?

1005
01:28:40,415 --> 01:28:43,680
Family is family
when we're together.

1006
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:52,991
Ki-joon,

1007
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:55,052
could you call me brother?

1008
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:57,962
Forget it,
why are you my brother?

1009
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:01,468
Come on, just once.
Let's just pretend.

1010
01:29:01,536 --> 01:29:02,798
No.

1011
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:07,473
Cocky prick.

1012
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:09,510
Fine, l don't like you either

1013
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:31,098
You up?

1014
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:33,892
What are you doing?

1015
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:36,460
Fortunately
the store was open.

1016
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:37,970
lt's late but you should
put on a service

1017
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:39,006
for your parents.

1018
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:56,190
Why? Don't know
how to do it?

1019
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:00,194
What's your mother's
maiden name?

1020
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:02,257
Kim, An-dong district.

1021
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:03,763
An-dong Kim?

1022
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:07,096
l'll give it a try.

1023
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:36,795
l hear the North have
services nowadays.

1024
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,696
Sit...

1025
01:30:43,237 --> 01:30:45,603
Would l report you
during a service?

1026
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,702
Did you know who l am?

1027
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:52,079
Did you know all along?!

1028
01:30:55,016 --> 01:30:56,278
Answer me!

1029
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,787
Stop this, Ki-joon.

1030
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:06,689
No, you're Ji-won,
Song Ji-won.

1031
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:09,792
Why did you keep me around?

1032
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:12,697
Why didn't you report me?

1033
01:31:13,534 --> 01:31:15,399
You're a small fish.

1034
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:18,601
A spy ring would be
a different story.

1035
01:31:19,941 --> 01:31:21,966
l found out that
you were abandoned

1036
01:31:22,043 --> 01:31:23,840
by your organization.

1037
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:25,776
So, now you want to sell me off.

1038
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,840
How much will they pay you?

1039
01:31:29,917 --> 01:31:31,179
Lower the knife.

1040
01:31:32,019 --> 01:31:33,577
Who knows what'll happen.

1041
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:35,750
lf everything goes well,

1042
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:38,087
we could just
continue our business.

1043
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:41,190
What will we do with our skills?

1044
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:45,294
We could make it big
if we cooperate.

1045
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:48,361
Then we hike up
the fees and

1046
01:31:48,436 --> 01:31:50,165
make some serious dough.

1047
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:51,705
And we'll help people too.

1048
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:55,169
Go on,

1049
01:31:55,243 --> 01:31:57,370
l'll give your parents a bow too.

1050
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:00,280
Go on.

1051
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:52,499
Hello? Oh, Kyung-nam.

1052
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:55,397
What? Son-tae?

1053
01:32:56,637 --> 01:32:57,695
Where are you?

1054
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:02,601
Yeah... yeah, okay.

1055
01:33:06,013 --> 01:33:07,480
l have to go out.

1056
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:10,575
Something happened
to a friend.

1057
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:23,161
Looks like the job of Shadow.
lt must be him.

1058
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:24,492
ls he back?

1059
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:34,708
l want to live.

1060
01:33:37,311 --> 01:33:39,575
l want to live!

1061
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:56,496
lt's Song Ji-won!

1062
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:06,705
Ji-won, do you remember me?

1063
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:09,867
We met briefly 6 years ago.

1064
01:34:09,944 --> 01:34:11,935
Lee told me all about you.

1065
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:13,275
l know about your situation.

1066
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:16,974
Shadow is active again.

1067
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:21,982
We just want to find him.

1068
01:34:23,224 --> 01:34:25,692
We can protect your secrecy.

1069
01:34:27,528 --> 01:34:28,688
Do you see me...

1070
01:34:31,432 --> 01:34:33,798
as a spineless traitor?

1071
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:36,003
Catch him!

1072
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:38,105
Catch him!

1073
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:39,406
Don't let him get away!

1074
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:55,784
Catch up to him!

1075
01:34:56,824 --> 01:34:59,884
Kyung-nam, let him go!

1076
01:35:00,327 --> 01:35:01,794
Sir, what are you saying?!

1077
01:35:02,129 --> 01:35:03,153
You know

1078
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:04,959
Shadow has abandoned him.

1079
01:35:05,032 --> 01:35:06,158
He has nothing to do with this.

1080
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:08,963
But he may still
be a link to Shadow.

1081
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:11,766
Please, give him 2 days.

1082
01:35:11,839 --> 01:35:14,399
When his family comes over,
he'll surrender.

1083
01:35:16,644 --> 01:35:18,771
How could we catch spies
with mercy and compassion?

1084
01:35:19,613 --> 01:35:22,582
You're putting me
in an awkward position.

1085
01:35:23,117 --> 01:35:26,280
Hey, Lee Han-kyu!

1086
01:35:48,142 --> 01:35:49,404
Please stop the car.

1087
01:36:00,121 --> 01:36:01,748
Hand over the GPS,

1088
01:36:01,822 --> 01:36:04,552
and tell me about Ji-won.

1089
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:06,388
We'll pay you handsomely.

1090
01:36:07,928 --> 01:36:09,555
Still same as always.

1091
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:10,961
What are you going
to do with him?

1092
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:12,862
He's blacklisted by Shadow.

1093
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:14,662
Would he still contact him?

1094
01:36:14,735 --> 01:36:16,965
So incompetent...

1095
01:36:17,037 --> 01:36:20,495
l'm asking for the GPS so that
you don't get involved in this.

1096
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:33,951
l could have you thrown in jail
if you don't comply.

1097
01:36:34,021 --> 01:36:36,649
Times have changed,

1098
01:36:36,724 --> 01:36:41,354
you can't just threaten
a civilian. Money?

1099
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:42,895
Perhaps a million?

1100
01:36:43,831 --> 01:36:46,766
Stop crediting yourself
for others' work.

1101
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:49,860
- Nothing's changed around here!
- Hey! Hey!

1102
01:36:49,937 --> 01:36:50,699
Get back in here!

1103
01:36:59,713 --> 01:37:01,544
There's no room
for mistake.

1104
01:37:01,615 --> 01:37:04,175
Shoot to kill if you have to.

1105
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:09,751
Ji-won, pick up the phone!

1106
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:12,054
There's a GPS tracker
in your watch.

1107
01:37:12,126 --> 01:37:13,559
They know where you are.

1108
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:15,390
So throw out your watch.

1109
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:30,868
What's his position?

1110
01:37:32,313 --> 01:37:33,473
He's at the bus terminal.

1111
01:37:35,216 --> 01:37:36,376
He's on his cell phone.

1112
01:37:37,818 --> 01:37:40,753
Producer Min, it's ln-joon.

1113
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:41,981
Yes, ln-joon.

1114
01:37:43,224 --> 01:37:45,556
l called you because this
may be the last time.

1115
01:37:45,626 --> 01:37:46,650
what are you saying?

1116
01:37:46,727 --> 01:37:51,096
l may have caused harm
to my family.

1117
01:37:54,435 --> 01:37:57,404
So please continue
the work even without me.

1118
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:01,498
l'm hanging up now.

1119
01:38:19,526 --> 01:38:20,458
We're exposed.

1120
01:38:20,527 --> 01:38:21,858
Take out the exposed
agents and

1121
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:24,693
track him until he makes
contact with Shadow.

1122
01:38:51,225 --> 01:38:52,886
Current position, Jongro.

1123
01:38:55,829 --> 01:38:58,195
Jongro? Who's there?

1124
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:06,294
Our country is giving you
a last chance.

1125
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:08,699
Prove yourself.

1126
01:39:10,511 --> 01:39:13,674
l can already feel
the bloodbath.

1127
01:39:26,026 --> 01:39:27,584
Contact the local
district authorities!

1128
01:39:54,922 --> 01:39:56,184
What's going on?

1129
01:39:56,623 --> 01:39:59,854
l don't know,
we just received an order.

1130
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:01,394
lt's probably nothing.

1131
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:22,573
He has a gun! Block him!

1132
01:41:01,221 --> 01:41:02,188
Coming to you,

1133
01:42:37,618 --> 01:42:39,245
He's within 40m.

1134
01:42:39,319 --> 01:42:41,287
- Spread out!
- Yes, sir.

1135
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:03,000
What are you waiting for?
Finish the job.

1136
01:43:07,214 --> 01:43:09,478
Ji-won! Song Ji-won!

1137
01:43:18,725 --> 01:43:22,889
What happened?
What about Shadow?

1138
01:43:25,332 --> 01:43:26,458
Anyway, l'm glad you're okay.

1139
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:27,966
There's no time,

1140
01:43:28,035 --> 01:43:29,662
give me your watch.

1141
01:43:29,736 --> 01:43:30,862
GPS tracker is in here.

1142
01:43:30,938 --> 01:43:32,303
Why didn't you answer
the phone?

1143
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:35,768
NlS knows your position,

1144
01:43:35,842 --> 01:43:37,673
they'll swarm the area soon.

1145
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:40,940
They might kill you,
so get out of here.

1146
01:43:41,014 --> 01:43:43,380
Professor, are you all right?
Get out of here.

1147
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:47,482
What's wrong?

1148
01:44:12,112 --> 01:44:13,977
Did the party send you?

1149
01:44:17,517 --> 01:44:19,485
Who sent you?

1150
01:44:21,221 --> 01:44:22,882
What is he saying?

1151
01:44:35,636 --> 01:44:39,299
Fucking traitor.
Talks too goddamn much.

1152
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:50,879
lt wasn't
an order from above?

1153
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:56,987
What?
Mind your own business.

1154
01:44:57,524 --> 01:45:00,391
Did you kill Tae-soon
on your own?

1155
01:45:02,829 --> 01:45:04,694
Killing traitors

1156
01:45:05,232 --> 01:45:06,893
is a privileged job
for our nation.

1157
01:45:11,838 --> 01:45:15,001
You're one of them now.

1158
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:18,778
l'm not a traitor.

1159
01:45:19,613 --> 01:45:23,982
Didn't you try
to defect your family?

1160
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:29,088
What happened to my family?

1161
01:45:30,824 --> 01:45:32,382
What do you think?

1162
01:45:39,933 --> 01:45:41,901
What happened to them?!

1163
01:45:49,843 --> 01:45:55,475
Ji-won, you dumb idiot.

1164
01:46:01,421 --> 01:46:06,358
l lost my colleagues, job

1165
01:46:06,426 --> 01:46:07,859
and my family because of you.

1166
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:11,455
lf you don't drop
the gun, he'll die.

1167
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:12,793
Go ahead.

1168
01:46:16,236 --> 01:46:17,567
Kill me!

1169
01:46:17,637 --> 01:46:18,968
Stop it, Ji-won.

1170
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:20,097
Bastard!

1171
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:32,185
Over here!

1172
01:46:39,126 --> 01:46:40,593

1173
01:46:42,028 --> 01:46:44,087

1174
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:01,574
We go down together.

1175
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:07,687
Ji-won!

1176
01:47:08,221 --> 01:47:10,451
No, Shadow is still alive!

1177
01:47:10,524 --> 01:47:12,583
- What about Ji-won?
- We couldn't verify.

1178
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:19,294
- He's still alive!
- Ji-won!

1179
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:22,197
Still alive!

1180
01:47:30,911 --> 01:47:33,379
Romantic bastards...

1181
01:47:50,931 --> 01:47:51,989
He's dead.

1182
01:47:52,332 --> 01:47:54,698
Cancel backup
and call paramedics.

1183
01:47:55,836 --> 01:47:56,996
Are you okay?

1184
01:48:02,242 --> 01:48:03,869
Ji-won, wake up!

1185
01:48:07,714 --> 01:48:08,681

1186
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:19,187

1188
01:48:39,212 --> 01:48:40,474
Wake up!

1189
01:48:42,215 --> 01:48:43,182
Ji-won!

1190
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:47,277
Hurry up!

1191
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:44,573
Call me when you're cut off.

1192
01:50:16,142 --> 01:50:17,074

Go see her for a change.

1197
01:50:29,823 --> 01:50:32,291
Don't just stay home
and wonder.

1198
01:50:33,927 --> 01:50:40,093
Perhaps it's time for me
to leave for somewhere familiar.

1199
01:50:40,834 --> 01:50:43,268
l don't think
l belong here either.

1200
01:50:43,336 --> 01:50:44,462
lt seems too hard

1201
01:50:44,537 --> 01:50:47,005
to buy a house and
raise Hyo-sun here.

1202
01:50:47,841 --> 01:50:49,365
lf there's any chance,

1203
01:50:49,442 --> 01:50:50,966

and even internet.

1206
01:50:59,419 --> 01:51:01,853
My daughter begged me for it.

1207
01:51:01,921 --> 01:51:03,354

1208

Anyway, take care
of things while l'm away.

1210

Yes boss, have a good flight!

Then can you get me
