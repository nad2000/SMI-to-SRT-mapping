00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:49,206
A long, long time ago,
there was a tree...

8
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:53,603
And a young man
who loved the tree.

9
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,145
Every single day
he came to the tree,

10
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,049
and collected

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,283
all falling leaves.

12
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,356
Hyung-sook,
l have to hang up.

13
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,396
- l'll call you back.
- Coming home...

14
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,956
this time for sure?

15
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:17,196
Of course,
no matter what.

16
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,366
You must teach her
to take daddy's call

17
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,378
even if she doesn't want to.

18
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,279
Maybe daddy didn't
educate her properly.

19
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,281
Educate?

20
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,644
lt's you, not me.

21
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,847
l gave her

22
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,856
the best education.

23
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,357
Sending her
to private school

24
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,790
isn't good education.

25
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,396
Sir! lt's Tae-soon!

26
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,664
You rarely saw her

27
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,859
- when you had the chance.
- Okay, fine.

28
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,162
l'll call you back later.

29
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,759
Don't bother.

30
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,667
l love you.

31
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,103
Bullshit!

32
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,102
Tae-soon, it's me.

33
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:59,809
Okay, l got it.

34
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,082
Thank you,
you're a good guy.

second-cousin

40
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,313
Doesn't make sense.

41
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,650
How long will it take?

42
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,742
About 3 days.

43
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,185
3 day? Not good enough!
Move over.

44
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,501
What the...

45
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,052
Excuse me.

46
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,892
Which way is
to Johan Cathedral?

47
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,793
Johan Cathedral?

48
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,894
Stay on this street...

49
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,101
l could guide you better
if you give me a ride.

50
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,475
Been well?

51
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,190
My kid's first birthday
next month.

52
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,194
Are you happy?

53
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,493
Yeah, you?

54
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,300
l'm leaving soon.

55
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,895
You must miss them.

56
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,673
How about a u-turn?

57
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,006
No police around.

58
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,707
- Now?
- Now.

59
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,277
Hey,
where are you going?

60
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,488
l'm sorry sir
l think l lost them.

61
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,685
lncompetent bastard.

62
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,996
Keep driving and go home,
you idiot!

63
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,502
Everyone get ready
and standby.

64
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,165
We don't know
wherethey'll end up

65
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,471
so wait in the car.
Confirm last location.

66
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,010
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

67
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:59,419
&nbsp

68
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,887
Shouldn't we call
the other team?

69
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,185
And give them
the credit?

70
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,283
We can take care
of it ourselves.

71
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,502
Excuse me.

72
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,512
l need to...

73
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:02,714
use the restroom.

74
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,989
Dance for me.

75
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,800
l said dance.

76
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,610
Trendy dance that
the kids here like.

77
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,096
Very nice.

78
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,199
Looks like
all our funding

79
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,004
went to dance classes.

80
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,444
Since you're more agile,

81
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,075
you come with me upstairs.

82
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,082
And you stay below.

83
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,758
What are you?

84
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,058
- Delivery man?
- Yeah.

85
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,565
Kyung-nam,
you look plain

86
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,294
even without the disguise.

87
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,363
You don't drive well,

88
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,099
get in the backseat.

89
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,679
lt's Gui Soong-min apartment!

90
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,907
Let's go!

91
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,882
Wait, who lives there?

92
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,556
Kim Sung-hak
Kim Jung-il's second cousin.

93
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,993
Fuck me.

94
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,199
Keep this.

95
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,510
After it's done, we'll part
on the first floor.

96
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,775
Rendezvous
at the terminal

97
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,076
and go back together.

98
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,583
Okay.

99
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,788
l can already feel
the bloodbath.

100
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:40,004
Accent in front,
out of the way!

101
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,200
lt's the director.

102
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,373
Lee Han-kyu here.

103
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,276
What do you think
you're doing?!

104
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,338
'Shadow' is on the move.

105
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,543
- lf we loose him...
- Shitbag!

106
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,642
Why didn't you
report this!

107
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,688
lt happened too quickly
so l'll report afterward

108
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,690
l got you.

109
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,385
That's all l need to do.

110
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,692
Who is it?

111
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,195
Morning,
l'm from the church.

112
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,097
ls Mr. Kim Sung-hak home?

113
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,306
He went to
the corner store.

114
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,175
You are... mother-in-law?

115
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,284
Yes, that's right.

116
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,076
Slow down, you'll trip.

117
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,783
l'm gonna get you!

118
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,007
What?

119
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,376
l don't think
this was necessary...

120
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,542
l'll be frank since
you're like my son.

121
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,451
Romantic Southerners
are whores.

122
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,988
Every one of them.

123
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,353
Look at them.

124
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,756
She married a defector
out of compassion and was killed

125
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,089
because of it.

126
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,494
Let's go in

127
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,208
We're here.
Where are you, Tae-soon?

128
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,690
You backstabbing rat,
take a good look.

129
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,155
You leached off our
nation's generosities

130
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,494
but publish a book
that taunt our leader?

131
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:58,294
l dreamt of killing you
every night.

132
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,966
- lt's apartment #1103.
- #1103...

133
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,511
You go first that way.

134
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,644
Clear the way!

135
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,778
- What's the floor?
- 11th floor!

136
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,763
- Comrade...
- Son of a bitch!

137
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,163
- He's just a child...
- Remember.

138
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,099
Our great nation
cannot have

139
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,697
a single fragile son.

140
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,501
How dare you
betray me?!

141
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,880
lt wasn't me.
l don't know anything.

142
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,792
Freeze!

143
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,565
l just live next door.

144
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,191
The boy was crying.

145
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,296
- Min-chul, head up.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,701
- No problem downstairs.
- Get up.

147
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,389
Hands up, asshole!

148
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,190
Target confirmed.

149
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,000
Check him.

150
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,505
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

151
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,008
He's okay.

152
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,304
ls that you Min-chul?

153
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,182
Min-chul!

154
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,185
Min-chul!

155
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,787
Son of a bitch!

156
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,086
What's going on?
Agent Ko!

157
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,092
Hey!

158
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,757
Get the car around
that side!

159
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,889
- Back off!
- Ko Kyung-nam!

160
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,794
- Agent Ko!
- Sir...

161
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,098
- Pull back right away!
- Sir, one went down!

162
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,899
Si-kyung!
Where's your mom?

163
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,480
- Take pictures of everything!
- Yes, sir.

164
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,279
Ko, give me the physical
description!

165
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,487
What's going on?

166
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,549
Over there, more people
coming out of there.

167
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,456
Yes, sir!

168
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,789
l said pull back!

169
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,466
Seal that exit!

170
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,002
Yes, sir. Out of the way!

171
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:23,306
6' tall wearing black suit

172
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,610
Out of the way!

173
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,350
- What the hell!
- Get in!

174
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,153
Are you okay?

175
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,888
- l'm fine, get in!
- Hurry.

176
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,457
- What about agent Kim?
- He's dead.

177
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,501
Shit!

178
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,199
Watch out!

179
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,278
Move! Move!

180
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,082
Step on the brake!

181
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,493
Shit!

182
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,587
Are you okay?

183
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,658
Go! Keep driving!

184
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,700
Yes, sir!

185
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,396
Watch out for the people!

186
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,185
Move! Out of the way!

187
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:20,992
Be careful.

188
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,103
l got you now.

189
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,179
- Floor it!
- Goddammit!

190
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,894
What the hell?

191
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,496
Why didn't you
request backup?!

192
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,203
Why?!

193
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,448
We can't keep up

194
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,977
with their pace through
normal chain of commands.

195
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,985
We must act first...

196
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,790
You be ready.

197
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,886
Hello?

198
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,801
l'm the agent in charge.

199
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,405
We're not
after you or Tae-soon.

200
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,968
Our target is

201
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,806
a North Korean assassin,

202
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,878
a high ranking officer.

203
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:02,879
He goes by many names

204
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,575
but commonly known
as Shadow.

205
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,378
That's who we want.

206
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,678
With your help,
we can get him.

207
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,582
l promise you
we'll help both of you

208
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,093
if we get him.

209
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,455
Tae-soon said
you graduated

210
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,498
from Kim Jung-il's
military school.

211
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,194
Aside from that,l don't know
anything about you.

212
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,197
Not even your face.

213
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,803
We can talk later
if you're in a situation.

214
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,039
l'll give you my number

215
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,675
Memorize it
011 865 92...

216
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,408
Betrayal, unforgivable

217
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,175
Two leaders
got together...

218
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:17,077
for the first time
in 55 years.

219
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,199
Hold on.

220
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,958
l suffered through
salary reduction

221
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,765
and disciplinary actions.

222
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,169
Now you want my throat?

223
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,799
Getting honorable
discharge

224
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,067
before official
staff reduction

225
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,807
is a generous way for us
to thank you for the work.

226
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:46,442
Having too many agents
on the field

227
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,952
is too much burden
for the agency.

228
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,282
Burden?

229
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,484
Were we getting paid
to fool around?

230
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,757
Our job is to catch
spies so

231
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,953
our people can
sleep soundly.

232
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,188
Times are changing.

233
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,294
Hostility is not
the answer anymore.

234
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,964
Their field operations are
coming to a halt.

235
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:08,767
Fine. But at least
let us finish this

236
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,705
before cutting us off.

237
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,572
l won't leave before
catching Shadow first.

238
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:17,672
Agent Lee
Stay out of this.

239
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,979
You've caused more
than enough problems.

240
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:26,748
l lost my teammates
who were like my family.

241
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,759
But l still have to
feed my real family.

242
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,192
You're divorced.

243
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,255
But l'm still
paying alimony.

244
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,697
What am l saying?

245
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,568
l can't just step down
during my prime.

246
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,663
This is why you
don't get anywhere.

247
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,868
You don't catch spies
to make money.

248
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,274
You're the reason

249
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:49,507
why our agency is
getting the bad rep.

250
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,481
Looks like this was decided
even before this meeting.

251
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,552
ls it because
of field problems?

252
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,144
Or getting divorced?

253
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,656
Just stick to one reason
for termination.

254
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,691
What did you say?

255
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:04,086
Do you know why l didn't
bother reporting?

256
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,962
What's the point?

257
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,694
You're goddamn
pushover and a tool.

258
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,398
You bastard!

259
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,103
Once is plenty enough.

260
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,804
Where do you think you are?!

261
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,138
Calm down, Agent Lee.

262
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:30,051
Let go of me!

263
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,646
Changing times? Fuck that!

264
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,885
l'm a federal agent
who catch commies!

265
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,979
6 years later

266
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,649
Hey, don't do it!

267
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,454
- You wanted it.
- lt won't be good.

268
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,585
- You were gonna do it.
- lt's dirty.

269
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:17,065
Hey miss
your food's great.

270
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,263
Could l take some photos
and post it online?

271
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,305
Online where?

272
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,368
An online club

273
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,171
for finding good restaurants.

274
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,711
Sure.

275
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,750
Come here
and give me a hand.

276
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,087
Quickly, customers
are waiting.

277
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,300
Here it is.

278
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:19,359
There're address, phone number
and even directions.

279
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,661
For extra $2,000,

280
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,667
we can bring her
back for you.

281
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:28,104
No, l'll go myself.

282
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:31,609
Okay.

283
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,479
Thank you.

284
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,285
Looks like your life
is hard enough.

285
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,957
l hope that
you'll be happier

286
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,999
when your wife comes back.

287
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,299
l'll be on my way then.

288
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,473
Hey, Yoon-ji.

289
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,600
Daddy?
l'm working right now.

290
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:11,448
Don't just like mommy.
You have to be good.

291
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,451
Yoon-ji,
don't call me too much.

292
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,147
Mommy won't like it.

293
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,154
Mommy's not there?

294
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:22,455
Don't worry about me, okay?

295
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,494
Hello?

296
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,960
Hey! lt's slanted!

297
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,088
Quit fooling around!

298
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,859
l'm paying each
of you $1,500.

299
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,596
You guys
are highway robbers!

300
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:41,307
Specialists in finding
runaway foreign wives

301
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,375
Chief!

302
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,350
Congratulations
on your promotion!

303
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,047
You didn't need to
come on a rainy day.

304
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,683
These guys were brokering
international marriages.

305
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,753
Vietnamese,

306
00:29:56,828 --> 00:30:00,787
Filipino, Cambodian and
other Asian countries.

307
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,495
They bring the girls over,
marry them

308
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:05,564
then convince them

309
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,764
that there're better men.

310
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,467
They're ripping off
poor farmers.

311
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,067
Look at this appalling face.

312
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,475
This is the boss.

313
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,982
He's half Korean
but worse than the Vietnamese.

314
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,140
But this is
an organization.

315
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:24,177
l know you're the best
man for this.

316
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,788
They must be stirring
quite a bit.

317
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:35,863
The department put high
reward on them.

318
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,401
About $60,000.

319
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,667
Sixty?

320
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,706
l hear they go to
the factory

321
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,866
where many
Vietnamese work.

322
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:49,505
The boss goes
nuts over soccer.

323
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:04,092
Go over there.
Sweep thoroughly

324
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,448
Playing basketball
in a soccer field, morons!

325
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,286
Hey!
What are you doing?

326
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,492
- You're not here to watch soccer!
- Okay.

327
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,069
- Jae-hwan.
- Yes, sir.

328
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,573
Do you see that guy
in Yankees hat?

329
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:51,904
Fat guy in white suit.

330
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:57,038
Yes.

331
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,140
l can't verify
from my position,

332
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,479
but what do you think?

333
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,647
l'll check up close.

334
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,744
Hey, hey!

335
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,789
Hey, hey! Not yet!

336
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,600
That crazy idiot!

337
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,674
l think it's him.
Should l grab him?

338
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,176
Do you want to get killed?
Get out of there!

339
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,212
Okay.

340
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,479
Jae-hwan! Jae-hwan!

341
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,659
Sang-chul,
l can't spot Jae-hwan.

342
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,665
Jae-hwan?

343
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:49,961
Did you see a guy
in Yankees hat?

344
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,059
A what? Yangi?

345
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,798
Find Jae-hwan first,
quick!

346
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,409
Why aren't you
answering me!

347
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,444
What are you doing here?
Boss is looking for you.

348
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,540
And why's your
radio set off?

349
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,777
You can't...

350
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,546
Boss, we're
fucked here.

351
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:15,091
All right, l'll be there.

352
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:27,768
Hey!

353
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,807
Do your worst, come at me.

354
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,278
That's it.

355
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,041
l'll get
the minions,

356
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,776
grab that bastard
over there.

357
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,478
Got it? Now!

358
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,893
Hey, where are you going?!

359
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,393
Shit!

360
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,500
Fake? Fake?

361
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,005
lt's a gas gun!

362
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,184
Hey, hey, stop, stop!

363
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,708
Stop it!

364
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,602
l called the cops.

365
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,384
Stop!

366
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,987
Stop!

367
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,584
l'm letting you live
because the game was tied.

368
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,391
l'll kill you...

369
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,696
if we meet again.

370
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,598
Shut it down!

371
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,455
Are you okay?

372
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,395
Yeah.
Are you a worker here?

373
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,601
You're a Korean.

374
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,906
Are you a cop?

375
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,469
No, l run a small...

376
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,945
They're wanted men.

377
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,447
l was after
the reward money...

378
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,780
with a gas gun.

379
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,885
Your name is?

380
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,286
What for?

381
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,059
Just want to thank you.

382
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,186
Ki-joon!

383
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,895
Go treat your wounds.

384
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:30,879
Hey!

385
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,187
What is it?

386
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:42,458
lt's weird to ask you
this like this,

387
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,893
but would you consider
working for me?

388
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,764
What type of work?

389
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,391
Finding people.

390
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,804
lt's a real enterprise
and well commended.

391
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,504
Looked like finding wasn't
the only thing.

392
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:08,749
Ah, that happens once every
10 years if l'm lucky.

393
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,343
l was helping
out local cops.

394
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,355
l'm find where l am.

395
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:17,360
Of course.
But l noticed that

396
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:21,159
you may be
an asset to me.

397
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,699
Your name was...?

398
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,662
Park Ki-joon.

399
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:30,571
Park Ki-joon.
Your fighting skills...

400
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,370
l mean, physical condition...

401
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,274
and you speak
Vietnamese well.

402
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,575
Where did you
learn to speak?

403
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,945
Most of our workers are
Vietnamese, so...

404
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:43,476
lt's perfect.
l'm in the business of

405
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,153
finding
Vietnamese women.

406
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:47,656
We haven't known each
other long

407
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,091
but why don't you
come work for me?

408
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,688
l like
my current work.

409
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:56,465
Of course.

410
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,399
lt's time
for me to go.

411
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,906
How about you call me.

412
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,775
Park Ki-joon
my ass.

413
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:14,675
l got you Ji-won.

414
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,095
Boss, are you okay?

415
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,300
Key.

416
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,402
Here.

417
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,803
Live well,
stop wasting your life.

418
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,312
He's really leaving.

419
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,373
Boss!

420
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,256
- Hello?
- lt's me.

421
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,259
- Who?
- lt's your daddy, idiot!

422
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,852
Who? Agent Lee?

423
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,590
- Kyung-nam.
- Yes, sir!

424
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,099
- l just hit the jackpot.
- Huh?

425
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,204
Who is it?

426
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,003
Pork feet!

427
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,310
Pork?

428
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:17,971
Sir!

429
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,382
You still go
around like this?

430
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:28,549
ls that true?

431
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,958
Like l said.
He's there as the manager.

432
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,859
Ji-won didn't
recognize your face?

433
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,557
Of course not,
he has never seen me.

434
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,656
But you recognized him?

435
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,758
l knew right away.

436
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,359
Man, weren't you surprised?

437
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,064
Did he not clue in?

438
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,072
l pretended
to be oblivious.

439
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,665
lf l acted like
l knew him,

440
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:46,801
it would've been
game over.

441
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,606
You know l have a knack
for acting.

442
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,447
ln any case, thank you.

443
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:54,678
My arrest rate
isn't great lately.

444
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,946
- Kyung-nam.
- Yeah?

445
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,683
l didn't call you
to hand him over.

446
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:02,992
Aren't you going to
report him in?

447
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,160
l'm leading this.

448
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,356
You're just
supporting me.

449
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:08,693
Do you get it?

450
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,100
No, l don't.

451
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:12,702
Keep it away from
the agency, you idiot!

452
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,105
Okay...

453
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,900
What's the reward
for spies nowadays?

454
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,310
$100,000

455
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:22,710
And spy ring?

456
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,279
Huh?

457
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,680
Unification Policy
Research Facility

458
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,186
You don't look well.

459
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,593
l met an NlS agent
a few days ago by chance.

460
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:22,098
Lee Han-kyu,

461
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,967
who looked for Tae-soon
and me 6 years ago.

462
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,102
Lee Han-kyu?

463
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:33,146
Yes. He asked me to work for him

464
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,878
as if he didn't recognize me.

465
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,754
Looks like
a private agency.

466
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,384
On the surface.

467
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,993
l'm sure
it's just his cover.

468
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:51,194
- So?
- l don't know.

469
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,303
Maybe submit
an undercover report.

470
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,807
Ji-won.

471
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,204
How about

472
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,143
- surrendering?
- You made me

473
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,978
into what l am
in military school.

474
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,579
And now you're asking me
to betray my country?

475
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:14,554
Like you?

476
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:15,683
Watch your mouth!

477
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,390
So what are you
going to do?

478
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,092
l've been on the
run for 6 years.

479
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:29,005
lt's time
to end this.

480
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,201
l won't visit you
again.

481
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,243
Won't it be better
to switch him over?.

482
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,649
ln an unofficial
route.

483
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,846
Like Tae-soon?

484
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,754
The spies are nuts
over working

485
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,452
for us after their
funding ran dry.

486
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,585
l already asked him
to work with me.

487
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,295
Yeah?
What did he say?

488
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:56,563
But he likes his work.

489
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,158
- What...
- Anyway,

490
00:43:58,235 --> 00:43:59,793
Come relief me when you're done.

491
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,347
- Hello?
- Sir, it's me.

492
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:16,045
Why didn't you show up
yesterday?

493
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,246
- The director's here.
- Hey!

494
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,188
- l'll call you back.
- You're the one who called.

495
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,459
ls he gone?

496
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,463
lt's Park Ki-joon,
we met a couple of days ago.

497
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:29,795
Who? Park Ki-joon?

498
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,101
Ah, Mr. Park!
Park Ki-joon!

499
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,600
Yes, sure.
How can l help you?

500
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,107
Ah, l see.

501
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,798
- Had lunch yet?
- Not yet.

502
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,606
How about a burger?

503
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,203
l don't like burgers.

504
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,373
Anyway, you chose wisely.

505
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,447
We have to push our
strongest traits.

506
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:23,645
Even the office workers

507
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,383
look for a way
out in their 40s.

508
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:31,058
l haven't
decided yet.

509
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,356
l wanted to hear
the conditions.

510
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:36,798
l see. You must need
a lot of money.

511
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,296
Downpayment
for an apartment.

512
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:45,199
Apartment? How big?

513
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:47,776
About 100m
